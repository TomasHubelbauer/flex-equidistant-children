# Flex Equidistant Children

This repository demonstrates a CSS layout where children of a flex element are spaced apart evenly.
This is useful for blocks where various labels can have different widths, but don't overlap one another
or get weirdly close where the labels are long while at the same time being far apart where the labels are short.

You can find the [**online demo** here](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/flex-equidistant-children/)
